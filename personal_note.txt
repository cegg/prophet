Hello Matteo and Niccol√≤.

This was a fun project, and whtever the outcome I will spend more time on improving it later. 
It took me somewhat longer than I expected, mostly because I changed the model couple of times while developing.
All together it took abbout 15 hours.

When I got the task, I considered 3 implementations:

1. Arithmetic caluculations
2. Mathematical extrapolation 
3. HMM

The first one seemed too simple, the second would require learning packages and techniques that I am not familiar with. 
So I decided to try HMM - it's pure statistics after all, and I know about its applications to weather forcasts, stock market and genetic info processigin in bioinformati, and I know about its applications to weather forcasts, stock market and genetic info processing in bioinformatics.
